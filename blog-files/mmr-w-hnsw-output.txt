Conversely, a more negative score reflects weaker associations such that Female ≠ Computer Science.
This would indicate that females are unconsciously seen as not being part of computer science.

strength and direction of three constructs (Female, Computer Science, and self) are used to determine

By changing how these associations are perceived on an implicit level, balance can be achieved,

Algorithm appears, individuals who strongly associate this with computer science will quickly sort it into

Internal reliability was checked for each IAT by correlating the D1 and D2 scores as outlined by
previous literature (Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003). The correlations across the three mid and three
post-survey IAT ranged from .54 to .69 and -.06 to .32, respectively. The reliability of the IAT comes from

Chunk 61
because they know that they still belong. There is this sense of connectedness and purpose because
these identities are seen as working well together (Jetten et al., 2017; Jetten et al., 2014).
Finally, no evidence was found supporting the hypotheses that happiness would moderate the
relationship between identity imbalance and short/long-term interest in computer science (H4). The
relationships were similar to the regressions, such that greater imbalance was related to lower levels of

Chunk 62
and the ethnic-science stereotype (Ethnicity = Scientist). In order to test our hypotheses, the
relationships between these three scores were needed to assess the level of balance for our
participants.
Establishing Balance. Using Greenwald and colleagues’ (2002) model as a guide, we tested our
balance conceptual model to see if identity balance was achieved across the sample. The balanced
identity design (BID) involves a two-step hierarchical regression analysis in which the first step uses the

though happiness did not increase it was sustained over time. Due to incomplete data, no further
analyses were done for the pre-survey data, as such the remaining analyses involved the mid and the

Research has also found that multiple conflicting identities can cause burnout and lower wellbeing because the individual is spreading cognitive resources and energy across multiple groups,
potentially becoming overwhelmed (e.g. Hirsh & Kang, 2016; Settles, 2004). For example, Settles (2004)
examined the relationship between identity centrality, or salience, in academic performance and

Overall, the reliability results suggest a moderate degree of stability across time. For the
majority of the analyses, the correlations were strong and positive. The only low-reliability coefficients
were for the post-test measure of the gender and the gender-computer science stereotype, which
showed r = .32 and r = -.06, respectively. A low-reliability coefficient will affect the overall results by
reducing the likelihood of finding statistically significant results.

closer to 0 indicate a perfect balance, such that the individual has strong positive associations towards
the constructs (see Figures 1-3 for balanced triads). Additionally, as the scores increase, they can be
reflective of the individual having small, moderate, or large imbalances between identities. Which may

Finally, moderations were conducted to test the last hypothesis that happiness will moderate
the relationship between identity imbalance and an interest in a career and taking classes in computer
science (H4). The findings from the second set of hypotheses for the post-survey data also indicated that
there is no statistically significant relationship between interest (short or long-term) and identity
imbalance. As such, moderations would not provide any significant insight as to whether or not

If there is a strong association towards a group (computer science), the adolescent’s identity
associated with that group (computer scientist) will be reinforced and made more important. If the
association is weak, however, identification towards that group will be weakened. The adolescent may
then struggle to express herself in a way that reflects belongingness to that group (Nosek et al., 2002).

Haslam, Haslam, Dingle, & Jones, 2014). These multiple compatible identities (Female and Computer

membership in these groups to be important. This importance may help in reducing any stressors or

contradictory associations, leading to a sense of negative well-being and not belonging. This feeling may

Identity Balance
Greenwald and colleagues (2002) proposed a theoretical model, balanced identity design (BID),
to describe configurations of balanced and imbalanced identities. The triads created from this model are

strongly associated more with one category over the other. These stimuli were derived from the
assumption that attitudes towards a certain group (ie., Me, Other, Computer Science, and Humanities)
are based on descriptors or names that are associated with that group (ie., I, Them, Code, and Art,
respectively; Greenwald, Banaji, Rudman, Farnham, Nosek, & Rosier, 2000). Additionally, these stimuli
came from the assumption that the constructs and categories are expected to be universally associated

Chunk 122
scores from .1 to .4999 reflect a small imbalance, scores ranging from .5 to .7999 are moderately
imbalanced, and anything .8 or greater are largely imbalanced. The greater the absolute value of the
difference scores, the larger the imbalance. A score of zero reflects perfect balance such that the
predicted and actual scores were the same for a certain IAT. If this were to occur for the remaining two
IATs, then the individual can be classified as being fully balanced.

The same explicit measures to the previous year of the project are being used to assess explicit

Obligations to family or other factors may make it so that the student is limited in what she can do in her
life. This can then lead to distress and anxiety, not from the stereotype but from not being able to
explore the field. Having too little or too many options may then lead to identity imbalance.

The associations between constructs are held both implicitly such that the relationships
between the constructs are unconscious and explicitly such that the relationships are known to the
individual. Implicit and explicit associations between constructs can be weakly correlated (Nosek, Banaji,
& Greenwald, 2002). For example, adolescents interested in computer science may state that being a
female and being a computer scientist is an important part of who they are. They may go on to state

identities, the individual is able to focus on the most important role at a given point in time.
They also found that by having this role separation the individual is able to use the positive
experiences of one role as a buffer for the negative experiences on the other identity. By doing so,
positive well-being is not affected by negative experiences because the roles are separated.
Alternatively, if both roles are experiencing negative outcomes, positive well-being will decrease, as

For the adolescent going through the crisis period who has general but vague commitments,
Marcia would describe this as the moratorium mode. The young adult has a genuine concern and
preoccupation about what to do in the future because she is in the process of exploring, but has not yet
decided on a set path. This is somewhat similar to the identity diffusion mode, but the difference is that

Preliminary Study
To further test the theoretical and mathematical models, we analyzed data obtained from a
pilot study we conducted examining Latino and African American former biomedical students. The
implicit relationships being tested were associations between self and science (science identity), self and
ethnicity (ethnic identity), and between ethnicity and science (science-stereotypes).
Data for this analysis came from Wave 23 of the longitudinal study, TheScienceStudy, that we

population. Esoteric and complicated stimuli make sorting difficult for the individual, reducing the
reliability and validity of the tests (Greenwald et al., 1998).
For example, the stimuli obtained for the gender identity IAT use stimuli taken from the test that
measures the strength of association between male and female (gender self-concept). These stimuli

pursuing a career in the field. The goal of this project was to examine if identity imbalance was related
to happiness and if implicit computer science identity was related to an interest (short and long-term) in
computer science. Specifically, it was found that both short-term and long-term interest in computer

relationship was found between happiness and class interest in computer science (short-term; H3c; r
(35) = .04, p = .808). Finally, no significant relationships were found between happiness and career

happiness has no relations with implicit associations towards computer science, how imbalanced the

is experimenting. At the same time, she is learning more about herself, her identity, and what leads to a
sense of happiness (Crocetti, Rubini, Luyckx, & Meeus, 2008). This student is able to engage in various
classes and opportunities that allow her to teach, interact with peers and instructors, and learn different
topics.

Chunk 152
reduction in effort leads to bad grades, reinforcing her negative implicit beliefs and associations towards
her science identity.
When an adolescent comes across a situation that is interesting (computer science) but is not
consistent with the current group’s norms (females cannot belong in computer science), the individual
may feel conflicted (Nosek et al., 2002). The preferences and beliefs of a group influence identity

towards computer science, nor does she see females as being part of computer science (Hirsh & Kang,
2016). In this case, she holds her gender identity as being most important.

Chunk 154
Participants
Data for this study came from 35 high school girls recruited from five schools in the North
County San Diego area, about seven students from each school (mid-point survey). Data from the postsurvey were also used to compare data sets (n = 32). The mid-point survey had a slightly greater sample
size, but data from the post-survey may also shed light as to how implicit computer science identity,

conducted to make the data normal.
Identity Imbalance
The mathematical model used in the preliminary study was used to calculate the participants’
identity imbalance and these implicit identity data will be correlated with the explicit happiness
measure. Greater scores on this scale indicated greater levels of imbalance, whereas scores closer to 0

Chunk 156
may deter them from pursuing this path, if not as a career choice.
Burke (1991) proposed a model that can help explain how identity is associated with the
development of anxiety. This model draws upon Mandler’s (1982) interruption theory, which states that
the unconscious plays a role in how the individual behaves in a situation. This occurs when a behavior or
thought process is interrupted. Interruption is defined as not being able to fully express oneself in a

Chunk 157
Explicit associations are typically measured via self-reports scales. Individuals report how they
feel or agree on a certain question (e.g., ‘Being a computer scientist is an important part of who I am,’
responses ranging from 1 Disagree to 5 Agree). These measures are subject to bias based on various
factors. When asked questions such as this one, the individual may answer relative to how she thinks or

happiness would have been a significant moderator 10.
Discussion
The triads for each time point allowed us to see how balance and imbalance were distributed in
our sample. On a surface level, these statistics revealed that level of balance increased while imbalance
decreased over a period of time. Further analyses with an increased sample size would need to be

Chunk 159
Preliminary analyses for mid-survey data were conducted to view distributions and descriptive
statistics of the variables. Histograms revealed that interest in a taking computer science classes (shortterm) has a negative skew (-0.67) Similarly, interest in a career in computer science (long-term) also
revealed a positive skew (0.73). Happiness was shown to be normally distributed (0.02). Implicit

Additionally, similar analyses should be conducted, sample size allowing, using the triads. In
addition to examining how identity imbalance relates to happiness, interest, and computer science
identity, being able to see how the various forms of balance and imbalance may provide further insight
as to how programs such as CodeQueens affect these students. Not only that, by using these triads, we

support the idea that the intervention had a positive influence on the girls wanting to learn more about
computer science beyond high school.
Strong positive implicit associations such that Me = Computer Science were related to stronger
interests in pursuing a career in computer science at the end of the program. Should this relationship

scientist but thinking that they do not belong due to their gender creates stress and anxiety. These
negative emotions and experiences may lead them dropping out of the path towards a field in computer
science. Changing these negative implicit associations between multiple important identities into more
positive (balanced) associations may help in reducing the threat and stress caused by the negative
stereotype that men, not women, belong in computer science.
Multiple Social Identities

Chunk 166
continues to fuel the social stereotype that men are computer scientists, not women. This makes it
difficult to identify as a computer scientist while maintaining a strong identity as a woman.
Identity
Every individual belongs to many different groups, and a sense of identity develops by
participating in the roles of these groups. For example, a nursing student can simultaneously identify as
being a nurse, a student, and a sibling. These identities have various levels of importance, and this

Chunk 167
importance changes over time and between situations. In this study, identity is defined as the extent to
which an individual attaches significance to a group or role that he or she belongs to (Veelen, Otten,
Cadinu, & Hansen, 2016). How these identities are associated with one another is important in
understanding the level of identity balance or imbalance of each person.

For those not in STEM, small to moderate correlations were found between imbalance and

the mathematical model used to quantify balance and imbalance. Overall, results showed that
imbalance was positively associated with implicit science identity for students both in and out of STEM.
The more imbalanced that the individuals were, the more students, both in and out of STEM fields,
identified as scientists. Another finding was that non-STEM students showed a positive relationship
between imbalance and implicit ethnic identity. Being in non-STEM fields revealed that these students

Chunk 174
stereotype that men, not women, belong in computer science.
Multiple Social Identities
Research examining the effects of multiple social identities has produced mixed findings. Some
research has found that multiple compatible identities are beneficial because one identity can help
reduce the stress experienced from another (e.g. Brook, Garcia, & Fleming, 2008; Hirsh & Kang, 2016;
Settles, Sellers, & Damas Jr., 2002). Settles and colleagues (2002) examined student-athletes and their

understanding identity development in adolescents.
Future research should increase the sample size and replicate the study to see if, in fact, these
findings hold true. Future findings may provide further insight into how identity imbalance, interest in
computer science, and happiness relate to one another in adolescent girls interested in computer

depression in White women-scientists and women-scientists of color. Settles measured the degree to
which women saw their gender and science identity as interfering with each other. Additionally, the
researcher measured the importance of being a woman and a scientist. She also measured well-being in
the form of self-esteem, depression, and life satisfaction. Settles found that women of color reported

lower GPAs, lower science performance, and more depression. Additionally, she found that women who
placed more importance on being women experienced greater interference between being a woman
and being a computer scientist. Women who had greater identity interference reported lower selfesteem, greater depression, and decreased life satisfaction. Women-scientists may be able to increase
self-esteem by leaving the science field, which may be a potential reason as to why women drop out of

a computer scientist. Should these negative associations persist, they may be carried over into
adulthood. Anxiety and stress may come from these relationships if there is a continued interest in
computer science. In other words, the negative implicit association that females ≠ computer science
continues into adulthood.
Lane, Goh, and Driver-Linn (2011) conducted a study in which they examined implicit and

suggesting that the students had balanced identities, similar to the previous model.
The final model used the interaction of implicit ethnic identity attitudes and implicit science

attendance. Having more schools and more students can help account for the low sample size.
Additionally, investigations into reducing attrition should be looked into. Experiences and interactions
with teachers that came from conducting this study have indicated that external responsibilities and
conflicts have interfered with lack of consistent commitment (i.e., no transportation, sports, family
responsibilities, work). Due to this reason, attrition may not be completely avoided, but further

it so that is not a possibility. This may lead to a reduction in positive well-being because she cannot do
what she is interested in. This adolescent is imbalanced such that she may have strong positive
associations as a female while believing that females can be in computer science, but she is unable to
identify as a computer scientist. She is unable to make this association because she is not given the
opportunity to make it so.

Chunk 188
Analyses were also conducted using post-program data as these changes were expected to be greater at the end
of the program. Additionally, mid-point survey data resulted in a slightly larger sample size n = 35, compared to the

may come from one of them. As these identities are seen as being related and compatible, the
adolescent may have an easier time seeing females as being part of computer science (balance). This
balance can then help them pursue a path to computer science, regardless of what the prevailing social
stereotype states.
Settles and colleagues (2002) also examined the effects of multiple identities on well-being. The

The relationships were as expected, however, greater imbalances related to lower interest in
classes and career options. It may be that these individuals do not identify with computer science,
because either they do not see themselves fitting in and/or they do not see their gender fitting in. They

science. They then use this to define what they can and cannot do (Ahlqvist, London, & Rosenthal, 2013;

It is expected that many high school females may be imbalanced due to the social stereotype
that men, not women, belong in computer science. This may have a significant impact on girls’ chances

measure implicit associations between two constructs. The IAT is a computer-sorting task in which

This disidentification with computer science can lead individuals to drop out of the computer
science pipeline, reducing gender diversity in the field (Woodcock, Hernandez, Estrada, & Schultz, 2012).

Similar to the mid-survey, a strong positive correlation between short-term and long-term
interest in computer science was found. Specifically, higher scores in short-term interest in computer
science related to higher scores in long-term interest in computer science, r (32)= .72, p < .001. This
indicated that having an interest in taking computer science classes (short-term) is strongly related to
having an interest in pursuing a career in computer science (long-term, see Table 12).

the imbalance scores and the explicit and implicit measures. We predicted that URMs with less

more balance, but the sample size was smaller (19 girls in the post compared to the 29 girls in the midsurvey).

To better understand balance and imbalance in our sample, we categorized each student into a
triad reflecting the kind of balance or imbalance she fit into. These triads were developed using their IAT
scores as stated by Greenwald and colleagues (2002) 6. We found that for the mid-survey data (n = 29),
the majority of the girls were imbalanced (61.6%) and the remaining were balanced (34.5%); with one of

It is plausible that identity imbalance may deter girls from pursuing a career in computer
science. This contradiction between important identities comes from having strong positive implicit
associations between self and computer science (Me = Computer Science), strong positive implicit

and computer science (Female ≠ Computer Science). She cannot identify as a female if she identifies as

that females can be a part of the computer science field, both as explicit statements. Unfortunately,
negative implicit associations may actually suggest that the individual does not strongly associate being

Explicit associations are typically measured via self-reports scales. Individuals report how they

For example, negative stereotypes about females in the science field may influence women to associate
less as a scientist, potentially leading to drop out.
Nosek and colleagues (2002) examined the relationship between gender identity and math
identity. Specifically, they examined how being part of a group that reinforces females in math
influences the strength of the female and math identity. Whether or not a stereotype is believed at the

These activities were modified from existing activities to reflect aspects of computer science

measures the strength of association between male and female (gender self-concept). These stimuli

compared these measures with the identity measures.

identity but not in the other (good grade on a test, but poor practice the same day), the student-athletes

associations between self and gender (gender identity) as well as gender and science (science

in a science related field. Additionally, they found that men and women who had strong associations
between their gender and science were more likely to pursue a career in the science field. Moreover,
they found that women who had strongly identified towards their gender and had strong associations

Three separate IATs were used: computer science identity, gender identity, and the stereotypic

Finally, time three data were collected the week following the showcase in April. This third point

girls completed the survey at the start of the meeting and then interacted with each other and the
mentors for the remainder of the club, sharing experiences and memories of what they have

Chunk 272
As previously mentioned, the Implicit Associations Test (IAT) uses reaction time and accuracy
when sorting stimuli to provide a score for the individual. This score is referred to as the D-score and
ranges from -2 to +2, positive scores indicating a strong positive relationship between the constructs,
such that Me = Computer Science, whereas more negative indicate weaker associations, such that Me ≠

D� diffcomputer science = D� computer science - Dcomputer science

These scores are then averaged out and the absolute value determines the range of imbalance.
Specifically, imbalance scores are interpreted as such: scores less than .0999 are considered balanced,
scores from .1 to .4999 reflect a small imbalance, scores ranging from .5 to .7999 are moderately

made using the associations between constructs to create a visualization of balance and imbalanced
identities. Constructs are ideas or mental concepts that are given meaning by an individual (e.g. self,
gender, computer science). Strong associations between the constructs of self and computer science, for
example, represent an individual’s computer science identity (Me = Computer Science). Associations
between self and gender represent the individual’s gender identity (Me = Female). Similarly,

short and long-term interests was assessed as well. Additionally, the relationships between happiness
and implicit levels of computer science, identity imbalance and interest in computer science were also
examined. Studying high school girls allowed us to examine if the emergence of identity is related to
implicit associations and well-being.
Adolescent females from five high schools participated in an after-school extended hackathon

The mentors taught the girls how to code and led the interventions that were used to help

she can be a computer science teacher (Hirsh & Kang, 2016). By doing so, the adolescent abandons her

they found that women who had strongly identified towards their gender and had strong associations

This study was conducted in an adult population and similar associations may be made by
female adolescents. Specifically, positive implicit associations between self and gender (Me = Female)
and the stereotype (Female = Science) may begin at a young age and then carry over into adulthood.

Settles and colleagues (2002) also examined the effects of multiple identities on well-being. The

They found that athletes, who saw their academic performance as being important, were more likely to

experience higher levels of anxiety, compared to boys (Crocetti et al., 2008) and this uncertainty may be
suggestive of imbalanced identities. This may be that by not knowing where they fit in, the adolescents

develop a sense of anxiety, similar to individuals in the identity diffusion and moratorium modes.

level of interest in taking computer science classes as well as pursuing a career in computer science (H1)
in the middle of the program. In other words, the more that the girls associate themselves to computer

well as the program that they would be using for the duration of the after-school club.
After the Hackathon, the girls began participating in an after-school program, titled
CodeQueens, that introduced them to computer science. During the first half of the program, the girls
were taught the fundamentals of coding and how to develop the building blocks of basic commands.
Undergraduate mentors were undergraduate computer science students from California State

adolescents strongly identify as female and as computer scientists, but the stereotype and other
external factors make it difficult for them to associate their gender as being a part of computer science.
In doing so, there may be tension from this sense of discomfort of being a female computer scientist.

them to make their game, and what challenges and success they encountered during the development
process. At the end of their presentations, the girls had their audience play their games as well as ask
questions about their games.
Judges came together and awarded teams based on various categories (e.g., creativity,
complexity, addressing the challenge). Additionally, the mentors also gave awards to individual students,

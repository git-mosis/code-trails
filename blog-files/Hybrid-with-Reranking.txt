Greenwald and colleagues (1998) outlined a 5-item per category test and a 25-item per category test. These shorter 5-item IATs were selected to account for time due to the fact that three IATs and the responses from the explicit measures were collected in one sitting. Implicit Computer Science Identity. The computer science identity IAT measured the level of association between self and computer science (Me = Computer Science). Positive scores reflect stronger associations towards a computer science identity. Negative scores, alternatively, reflect negative associations between self and computer science such that the individual does not identify as a computer scientist (Me = Humanities). Implicit Gender Identity. This IAT measured how strongly the person associates themselves towards the stated gender (female), the stronger the association the more the individual identifies with their gender (Me = Female). Weaker associations, in turn, reflect poorer identification towards the female g

Preliminary analyses for mid-survey data were conducted to view distributions and descriptive statistics of the variables. Histograms revealed that interest in a taking computer science classes (shortterm) has a negative skew (-0.67) Similarly, interest in a career in computer science (long-term) also revealed a positive skew (0.73). Happiness was shown to be normally distributed (0.02). Implicit computer science identity was shown to be negatively skewed (-0.18). Identity imbalance was shown to be very skewed and logarithmic transformations were conducted to adjust for this. As such, the data became more normal (0.53; see Figures 12-16 for distributions).

college, they were asked what career they were in and if it was science related (mathematician, computer scientist, etc.). These survey data were compared with additional data requested from the National Student Clearing House ([NSC] 2017). This provided information about what colleges the participants attended, what they majored in, and when they graduated. This information was coded to reflect if participants were in or out of a STEM field (1 = In STEM). Participants were in STEM if their career or major reflected these fields (engineer, computer programmer, a chemistry major, a biology major, etc.). The final analytic sample included 170 participants who completed the survey items, as well as the three IATs. These IATs measured ethnic identity (Me = Ethnicity), science identity (Me = Scientist), and the ethnic-science stereotype (Ethnicity = Scientist). In order to test our hypotheses, the relationships between these three scores were needed to assess the level of balance for our pa

Regardless of whether the girls had completed all three IATs, any useable implicit computer science IAT data were used in the analyses. 9 The effects of happiness on the relationships between identity imbalance and short-term interest in computer science of 26 high school girls were examined. Hayes PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2012) was used to regress girls’ short-term and long-term interest in computer science onto identity imbalance. Happiness was not a significant moderator in the relationship between identity imbalance and short-term interest (b = -.24, SE = 1.21, p = .843) or long-term interest (b = -1.38, SE = 1.56, p = .385). 8  revealed a slight negative skew (-0.46). Happiness was shown to have a slight negative skew (-0.31). Implicit computer science was slightly positively skewed (0.57).

As the strength of interest in a computer science career increases, implicit computer science identity increases as well. H2a.

Specifically, imbalance scores are interpreted as such: scores less than .0999 are considered balanced, scores from .1 to .4999 reflect a small imbalance, scores ranging from .5 to .7999 are moderately imbalanced, and anything .8 or greater are largely imbalanced. The greater the absolute value of the difference scores, the larger the imbalance. A score of zero reflects perfect balance such that the predicted and actual scores were the same for a certain IAT. If this were to occur for the remaining two IATs, then the individual can be classified as being fully balanced.

For the majority of the analyses, the correlations were strong and positive. The only low-reliability coefficients were for the post-test measure of the gender and the gender-computer science stereotype, which showed r = .32 and r = -.06, respectively. A low-reliability coefficient will affect the overall results by reducing the likelihood of finding statistically significant results.

forms of recognition helped the girls see their successes and accomplishments as CodeQueens, as well as being able to show these to others. Most importantly, it allowed them to realize that these games were something that they developed on their own and with the help from others, further establishing their role as computer scientists. Finally, time three data were collected the week following the showcase in April. This third point of data collection was done at each of the high schools during the last CodeQueens Club meeting. This was a way to celebrate the end of the year as well as their accomplishments during the program. The girls completed the survey at the start of the meeting and then interacted with each other and the mentors for the remainder of the club, sharing experiences and memories of what they have accomplished during the program. Additionally, this served as a way for the Senior students to share what their career or academic plans were after they graduate. Implicit M

able to see themselves as being part of STEM fields. As this interest remains over time, the adolescents may continue to pursue this path, leading to gender and ethnic diversification in STEM careers, in this case, computer science. As this interest remains and is pursued, a positive feedback loop may come into place. As young women interested in computer science participate in programs such as CodeQueens, they may participate in or develop similar interventions. This brings in more young women interested in computer science, further diversifying the field, who may then come to develop their own programs. This loop creates a larger interest in the field, potentially reducing the gender gap and reducing the effects of the social stereotype that men not women are computer scientists.

Implicit Associations and Identities The implicit associations test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998) is a commonly used method to measure implicit associations between two constructs. The IAT is a computer-sorting task in which individuals place stimuli presented on the center of the screen (e.g., the words Algorithm or Literature) into categories set at the bottom of the screen (e.g., Computer Science and Me or Liberal Arts and Others). The speed and accuracy of sorting the stimuli are used to quantify the strength of the implicit associations or identities. The quicker and more accurately the individual sorts the stimuli, the higher their score will be; this reflects a stronger association. Slower and/or inaccurate responses, in turn, lead to lower scores. These scores range from -2 to +2, where a more positive score is related to stronger associations towards a specified pairing. For example, if the constructs Female and Computer Science are paired such that Female = Computer Science,

Figure 18. Unknown triad B where an individual had negative associations towards female and computer science as well as weak associations between female and computer science. Analyses To test the first set of hypotheses, bivariate correlations for 29 high school girls 7 were conducted to test if implicit computer science identity was related with an interest in a computer science career or an interest in taking computer science classes. Results indicated a statistically significant relationship such that implicit computer science identity had a strong positive relationship with short-term (class) interest in computer science, r (29) = .37, p = .046 (H1a). Students with higher computer science identities tended to be more interested in taking computer science classes. Additionally, results indicated that implicit computer science identity and long-term (career) interest in computer science were not significantly related (H1b), r (29) = .33, p = .077 (see Table 11).

t (166) = .15, p = .88. Once again, the interaction between ethnic identity and science identity can significantly predict ethnic-science stereotypes. Identity Imbalance Correlates. We calculated imbalance scores for our sample to examine the relations between identity imbalance and measures of well-being (perceived stress, subjective happiness, joy in work; see Table 2). Initial analyses revealed that identity imbalance was very positively skewed. Logarithm transformations were conducted to adjust this and as such the data become more normal (n = 170, M = -0.29, SD = 0.28; see Figure 7 for distribution). We ran bivariate correlates between the imbalance scores and the explicit and implicit measures. We predicted that URMs with less imbalance would have more positive well-being and less negative well-being. Well-being was assessed using four measures: perceived stress (Cohen, Kamarck, & Merlmestein, 1983), subjective happiness (Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999), a joy in work scale developed

the mathematical model used to quantify balance and imbalance. Overall, results showed that imbalance was positively associated with implicit science identity for students both in and out of STEM. The more imbalanced that the individuals were, the more students, both in and out of STEM fields, identified as scientists. Another finding was that non-STEM students showed a positive relationship between imbalance and implicit ethnic identity. Being in non-STEM fields revealed that these students were both more imbalanced in their identities and identified more with their stated ethnicity on an implicit level. Unfortunately, neither imbalance nor STEM involvement was significantly associated with the measures of positive and negative well-being. These measures and relations were examined in adults who had already pursued careers, either in or out of STEM. The findings were non-significant, but we expected that examining identity and wellbeing in adolescents would provide insight as to how i

Hacking the Stereotype: The Relationship Between Computer Science Identity Imbalance and Happiness in High School Girls Female students are widely underrepresented in most science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) bachelor’s degrees, including computer science (National Science Foundation [NSF], 2017). Over the past 10 years, the number and proportion of computer science bachelor’s degrees earned by women in the United States have decreased (NSF, 2017). Additionally, the NSF reports that 49% of the nation’s scientists and engineers are White men, while White women make up the second largest portion at 18%. Asian men and women make up a combined 21% of science and engineering occupations. Men and women from Black, Hispanic, and other races make up the remaining 12%. Specifically, about 2% of the nation’s engineering or computer scientists are Hispanic women (NSF, 2017). This disidentification with computer science can lead individuals to drop out of the computer science p

between important identities that lead to imbalance. This imbalance is caused by a feeling of contradictory associations, leading to a sense of negative well-being and not belonging. This feeling may persist as she continues into adulthood if it is not resolved. Identity Balance Greenwald and colleagues (2002) proposed a theoretical model, balanced identity design (BID), to describe configurations of balanced and imbalanced identities. The triads created from this model are made using the associations between constructs to create a visualization of balance and imbalanced identities. Constructs are ideas or mental concepts that are given meaning by an individual (e.g. self, gender, computer science). Strong associations between the constructs of self and computer science, for example, represent an individual’s computer science identity (Me = Computer Science). Associations between self and gender represent the individual’s gender identity (Me = Female). Similarly, associations between c

STEM Involvement. There was a significant relationship between STEM involvement (either in or out of a STEM field) and the implicit science identity measure, r (161) = .29, p < .001, which is to be expected. Being in STEM was related with implicitly identifying as a scientist. Correlating STEM involvement to ethnic and science-stereotype implicit measures revealed no significant relationships, r (161) = -.01, p = .931 and r (161) = .01, p = .868, respectively (Table 2). This suggests that being involved in STEM-related fields was associated with higher levels of implicit science identity, but not ethnic identity or science-stereotype. Individuals in STEM fields implicitly identified more like scientists. This study was conducted with adults who may have established their career and educational paths. In doing so, they have also established their identities in regards to ethnicity and science. Due to this reason, their identities are set and may not be subject to change. These identitie

Finally, moderations were conducted to test the last hypothesis that happiness will moderate the relationship between identity imbalance and an interest in a career and taking classes in computer science (H4). The findings from the second set of hypotheses for the post-survey data also indicated that there is no statistically significant relationship between interest (short or long-term) and identity imbalance. As such, moderations would not provide any significant insight as to whether or not happiness would have been a significant moderator 10. Discussion The triads for each time point allowed us to see how balance and imbalance were distributed in our sample. On a surface level, these statistics revealed that level of balance increased while imbalance decreased over a period of time. Further analyses with an increased sample size would need to be conducted in order to determine if these changes were significant. In doing so, it will give more validity to programs similar to CodeQuee

Science) or their gender with computer science (Female ≠ Computer Science; see Figure 2). This adolescent has an interest in computer science and identifies as a female. No positive associations towards being a computer scientist, or of females as being a part of computer science are made. In order to protect herself from the stereotype threat she identifies as a female, but makes no relation towards computer science, nor does she see females as being part of computer science (Hirsh & Kang, 2016). In this case, she holds her gender identity as being most important.  Figure 2. Balanced identity for students interested in computer science (Balance B).

Another form of balance (Balance C) can come from female students who have a strong association between themselves and computer science (Me = Computer Science), but weak associations be

studies, but as time goes on it becomes apparent that she is not as involved in the class as she was in the beginning. Though she still endorses her original statement, on an implicit level she may not hold such strong associations between females and computer science. This negative associations, in turn, affect her such that she unconsciously believes that she cannot successfully be a part of computer science. This reduction in effort leads to bad grades, reinforcing her negative implicit beliefs and associations towards her science identity. When an adolescent comes across a situation that is interesting (computer science) but is not consistent with the current group’s norms (females cannot belong in computer science), the individual may feel conflicted (Nosek et al., 2002). The preferences and beliefs of a group influence identity development. By suppressing one identity (e.g. female) and making another (e.g. computer science) more important, the individual reduces any inconsistenci

Similarly, no evidence was found to support the relationships between happiness and implicit computer science, identity balance, or interest (short and long-term; H3). Though these relationships were non-significant, results indicated that there was no relationship at all between happiness and implicit computer science or happiness and interest in computer science (neither short-term nor longterm). This may indicate that explicit happiness has little or nothing to do with how the girls implicitly identify as computer scientists, or how interested they are in computer science classes or careers. It may be the case that the girls compared their level of happiness to their fellow CodeQueens. By this time (about halfway through the project) the girls have made relationships with others and learned more about their peers. In doing so, they view their level of happiness in comparison to the others. In other words, at the start of the program, they did not know each other and reported how hap

may come from one of them. As these identities are seen as being related and compatible, the adolescent may have an easier time seeing females as being part of computer science (balance). This balance can then help them pursue a path to computer science, regardless of what the prevailing social stereotype states. Settles and colleagues (2002) also examined the effects of multiple identities on well-being. The researchers examined student-athletes and assessed their athletic identity and their academic importance. They also measured well-being using self-esteem, perceived stress, and depression scales. They found that athletes, who saw their academic performance as being important, were more likely to see these roles as being separate. If these roles interfered with one another, the responsibilities of being a student made it difficult to complete the responsibilities of being an athlete, the participants reported more stress and more depressive symptoms. A student-athlete may find it e

From both the mid and the post-time points, class interest (short-term) and career interest (long-term) in computer science were found to be positively related. These findings suggest that interest in learning about and pursuing a career in computer science are sustained over a period of time. Future research should examine if this significantly changes across the 16-weeks of the CodeQueens Club and if there are any significant mediators in this relationship. This may help in further developing strategies and interventions designed to increase and sustain interest in taking computer science classes and following in the computer science career path. This study has found that implicit levels of computer science are related to interest in computer science in both short-term and long-term. This leads into one of the limitations of the study: sample size. This program was initially designed to be a three-wave long study assessing changes in identity, imbalance, and well-being over the lengt

experience higher levels of anxiety, compared to boys (Crocetti et al., 2008) and this uncertainty may be suggestive of imbalanced identities. This may be that by not knowing where they fit in, the adolescents may not identify as being part of certain groups. By not knowing what to pursue, the adolescents may develop a sense of anxiety, similar to individuals in the identity diffusion and moratorium modes. This may be reflective of girls who are interested in computer science but feel as if they cannot do so. This may be due to the stereotype, or it may be due to external factors that prevent them from pursuing the field. They explore different career options and this may then overwhelm the adolescent because they’re not sure of what to pursue. This, in turn, may then lead to stress and anxiety. It may also be that the adolescent it not overwhelmed, but rather they but they do not know what to pursue. They have many interests but they are unsure as to which one will lead to a sense of

A student who has many options to choose from may by considering a career in computer science. She takes classes and is exposed to what the field has to offer. Unfortunately, because of the stereotype and the abundance of potential options, she may choose a field that does not come with stress and contradictions due to being a female in the field. It may also be that the student does have an interest in computer science but outside influences have not made that an option to choose from. Obligations to family or other factors may make it so that the student is limited in what she can do in her life. This can then lead to distress and anxiety, not from the stereotype but from not being able to explore the field. Having too little or too many options may then lead to identity imbalance. The next model is foreclosure and here the adolescent has not yet explored the options available but has concluded what path to pursue. Her parents, without much input or expression of her identity, may ha

industry during the Showcase at the end of April. During this time the mentors shifted roles from instructors to advisors. The girls had learned what they needed to get started and the whole club meeting was used to develop their games. Some of the girls wanted to create actions that were not taught, others wanted to use a new program entirely. Regardless of their decisions, they were able to complete their games and the mentors realized that the girls were gradually becoming less dependent on their guidance. Throughout the 16 weeks, the students were given examples of real-world coding projects and they learned the foundations that led to the development of the process. During this time, the girls related what they have learned to their own personal goals and values. This was done via intervention strategies in the form of short activities that were developed in the lab.
